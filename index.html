                <p class="p1">
                    The Dongria Kondh tribe is an Indigenous community living in the Niyamgiri hills of Odisha, India. The tribe has a rich culture and history, and its people are deeply connected to the natural world. The Dongria Kondh tribe relies on farming and forest produce for their livelihood.
                    In 2006, the Indian government granted a mining lease to <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/vedanta-resources-lawsuit-re-dongria-kondh-in-orissa/#:~:text=In%20April%202013%2C%20India's%20Supreme,mining%20project%20may%20go%20ahead." target="_blank">Vedanta Resources</a>, a private company, to mine bauxite in the Niyamgiri hills.

                <p class="p2">
                    Bauxite is a mineral that is used to make aluminum. The mining project would have displaced thousands of Dongria Kondh people from their traditional land and destroyed their forests.The Dongria Kondh tribe resisted the mining project, arguing that it would violate their cultural and religious rights. The Dongria Kondh tribe believes that the Niyamgiri hills are sacred and that mining would be a sacrilege. The tribe also argued that the mining project would destroy their traditional way of life and reduce their income.
                    The Dongria Kondh tribe's resistance to the mining project gained national and international attention. In 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the Dongria Kondh tribe and cancelled the mining lease. However, Vedanta Resources has appealed the Supreme Court's decision and the case is still pending.
                    The story of the Dongria Kondh tribe is a story of survival. The tribe has faced many challenges, including displacement, poverty, and discrimination. However, the Dongria Kondh tribe has persevered and continues to fight for their rights and their way of life.

                        <h2>The illegal refinery</h2>
                        <p>Before obtaining permission to mine, Vedanta built a refinery in the town of Lanjigarh and began work on the conveyor belt that would transport bauxite directly from the hills to the refinery. The government approved the refinery on the condition that no forest land would be used, but this claim was proven to be false. Vedanta annexed 60 hectares of village forest, which is essential for the livelihoods of local communities. The refinery also completely destroyed the village of Kinari, displacing over a hundred Majhi Kondh families to a settlement known locally as the "rehab colony." This is a walled compound of concrete houses surrounded by barbed wire. The residents of the rehab colony have no farmland, and while some work as laborers for Vedanta, most survive on handouts.</p>

                        <h2>Health</h2>
                        <p>The Kondh villagers blame pollution from the refinery for a range of health problems, including skin diseases, livestock diseases, and crop damage. The refinery's main waste product is a toxic slurry known as <a href="https://www.science.gov/topicpages/b/bauxite+red+mud" target="_blank">"red mud."</a> When red mud dries in the sun, it turns into a fine dust that can be inhaled by people and animals. Government pollution inspectors have found that red mud seepage from the refinery has contaminated groundwater. They have also described the seepage as "alarming" and "continuous." In addition, red mud has leaked into the Vamsadhara River, a major source of water for the region.</p>

                        <p>
                            The mine would clear large areas of forest, fragmenting the landscape, disrupting wildlife, and increasing erosion. It would also generate air and water pollution, increase pressure on wildlife and resources, damage roads and infrastructure, and exacerbate water shortages in the drought-prone Kalahandi area.
                            The refinery's red mud waste has contaminated groundwater and the Vamsadhara River, and its dust can cause health problems.
                            The Indian government must protect the environment and its citizens by denying Vedanta's proposal and addressing the damage already caused.

                        <h2>Resistance</h2>
                        <p>The Dongria Kondh tribe has resisted Vedanta's mining project since it was first proposed in 2006. They have held roadblocks, formed human chains around the Mountain of Law, and even set a Vedanta jeep alight when it was driven onto the mountain's sacred plateau.
                            The Dongria Kondh tribe's resistance has been met with threats and intimidation from Vedanta and the government. However, the tribe has remained determined to protect their land and way of life.
                            In 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the Dongria Kondh tribe and cancelled the mining lease. However, Vedanta has appealed the Supreme Court's decision and the case is still pending.
                            The Dongria Kondh tribe's resistance has inspired indigenous peoples across India and around the world. Their story is a testament to the power of community and determination to protect what is sacred.

                        The process in which a publicly-traded company is taken over by a few people is also called privatization. The stock of the company is no longer traded in the stock market and the general public is barred from holding stake in such a company. The company gives up the name 'limited' and starts using 'private limited' in its last name.

                <h1>Government Reforms in the 90s</h1>
                <p>In July 1991, India introduced economic reforms that aimed to stabilize the economy in the short-term while restructuring institutions for long-term growth. The immediate focus was restoring balance of payments and controlling inflation. However, changing the institutional structure through reforms was equally important for long-term objectives.
                    The government quickly implemented fiscal measures to stabilize the macroeconomy. Additionally, reforms were initiated in trade, industry, and the public sector to transform their structure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The 1993 Discussion Paper on Economic Reforms by the Ministry of Finance outlined the objectives of the reforms: to rapidly improve the quality of life of all Indians through fast income and employment growth. This requires productive investment in farms, roads, irrigation, industry, power, and most importantly, people. Sustained development depends on continuing productivity growth of capital, land, and labor.
                    Within a generation, East Asian countries hugely increased their living standards through such reforms. India aimed to achieve similar transformations.

                    <p>Monetary reforms aimed to eliminate interest rate distortions and rationalize the lending rate structure.
                        <br>
                        Reforms tried to make the banking system more efficient through several measures:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span>
                            Reducing statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and cash reserve ratio (CRR) as per the 1991 Narasimham Committee Report. In 1991, SLR and CRR were very high. SLR was proposed to be cut from 38.5% to 25% over 3 years. Similarly, CRR was to be reduced from 25% to 10% over 4 years.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Liberalizing interest rates. Earlier, RBI controlled deposit rates for different maturities and lending rates for sectors. Interest rates on time deposits were decontrolled starting with longer maturities. This was progressively extended to shorter maturities.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Increasing competition among public, private and foreign banks by removing administrative constraints.

                        <br>
                        Rationalizing the branch network by liberalizing bank branch licensing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Allowing banks flexibility in relocating and opening specialized branches.

                        <br>

                        <span>
                            Abolishing industrial licensing for all except 18 industries, taking 80% of industry out of the licensing system.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Repealing the Monopolies & Restrictive Trade Practices Act to remove the requirement for large companies to seek prior approval for expansion or diversification.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Reducing the number of areas reserved for the public sector from 17 to 8 focused on strategic concerns like railways and atomic energy. This allowed greater private sector participation in core and basic industries.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Encouraging disinvestment of government equity in public sector enterprises.

                        <br>
                        Providing greater autonomy and professional management to public sector units through Memorandums of Understanding with ministries. This aimed to help them generate reasonable profits by setting performance targets.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Overall, the reforms substantially deregulated industry to promote a more efficient and competitive industrial economy.

                        <br>
                        In 1991, the government announced a specified list of high technology and high-investment priority industries wherein automatic permission was granted for foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 51 percent foreign equity. The limit was raised to 74 percent and subsequently to 100 percent for many of these industries. Moreover, many new industries have been added to the list over the years.
                        Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has been set up to negotiate with international firms and approve direct foreign investment in select areas.
                        Steps were also taken from time to time to promote foreign institutional investment (FII) in India.

                    <h1>Privatisation in Mining</h1>
                    <p class="p1">
                        Privatization in the mining sector refers to the transfer of ownership and control of mining assets from the government to private companies. This can be done through a variety of mechanisms, such as:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span>Divestment:</span> The government sells its shares in state-owned mining companies to private investors.
                        <br>
                        <span>Leasehold:</span> The government grants mining leases to private companies for a specified period of time.
                        <br>
                        <span>Contract mining:</span> The government contracts with private companies to mine its minerals.
                        <br>
                        Privatization of the mining sector has been a major trend in recent decades, as governments around the world have sought to reduce their role in the economy and attract private investment.

                        India has privatized a number of mining assets in recent years. The results of this privatization have been mixed.
                        On the one hand, privatization has led to increased investment in the mining sector and increased production. For example, the production of iron ore in India increased from 220 million tonnes in 2000-01 to 1.2 billion tonnes in 2015-16.
                        On the other hand, privatization has also led to environmental damage, social displacement, and corruption. For example, the mining of bauxite in the Niyamgiri hills of Odisha has led to deforestation and water pollution. The mining project has also displaced indigenous communities and caused health problems.

                <p class="p1">
                    Illegal mining is the extraction of minerals without a permit or license. It is a serious crime in India and can have a number of negative consequences, including environmental damage, social displacement, and loss of revenue to the government.
                    The extent of illegal mining in India is difficult to quantify, but it is estimated to be a multi-billion dollar industry. Illegal mining is particularly prevalent in states such as Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh, which are rich in mineral resources.
                    There are a number of factors that contribute to illegal mining in India, including weak enforcement, corruption, poverty, and high demand for minerals.

                    <a href="https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0663_English.pdf">Traditional livelihoods in India</a> are those that have been practiced by communities for generations. They include agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, and handicrafts.

                    Traditional livelihoods are important because they provide food, income, and a sense of identity for millions of people in India. They also play an important role in preserving India's cultural heritage.
                    
                    However, traditional livelihoods are facing a number of challenges, including land degradation, water scarcity, competition, and lack of government support.
                    
                    The Indian government can support traditional livelihoods by investing in sustainable practices, providing subsidies, promoting marketing, and protecting the rights of marginalized groups.
                    
                    By supporting traditional livelihoods, the Indian government can help to reduce poverty, improve food security, and preserve India's cultural heritage.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Loss of access to land and resources :</span> Privatization can lead to the transfer of land and resources from communities to private companies, which can restrict communities' access to their traditional livelihoods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Increased competition :</span> Privatization can lead to increased competition from large-scale commercial enterprises, which can make it difficult for small-scale traditional producers to compete.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Exploitative labor practices :</span> Private companies may engage in exploitative labor practices in order to reduce costs and maximize profits.

                    <span>Loss of control over traditional knowledge and practices :</span> Privatization can lead to the loss of control over traditional knowledge and practices, as private companies may seek to patent and commercialise these resources.

                <p class="p2">
                    Governments can mitigate the negative impacts of privatization on traditional livelihoods by strengthening land and resource rights for communities, ensuring that privatization is done in a transparent and accountable manner, providing support to small-scale traditional producers, regulating private companies to prevent exploitative labor practices, and protecting traditional knowledge and practices.

                    Privatization can lead to displacement, which is particularly challenging for marginalized groups. These groups often adopt a number of survival strategies, such as migrating to urban areas, engaging in informal sector work, relying on social networks, and engaging in resistance movements.

                    Privatization has been a key component of India's economic reforms since the early 1990s. While privatization has led to some economic growth and efficiency gains, it has also exacerbated income inequality, particularly among marginalized groups.


                    There are a number of reasons for this. First, privatization has led to job losses in many sectors, particularly among marginalized groups who are disproportionately employed in public sector jobs. Second, privatization has led to wage stagnation, as private companies often pay lower wages than public sector employers. Third, privatization has led to a decline in the quality of public services, which disproportionately affects marginalized groups who rely more on public services than other groups.


                    The following are some specific examples of how privatization has exacerbated income inequality among marginalized groups in India:

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The privatization of the power sector has led to higher electricity prices, which has disproportionately impacted marginalized groups who live in poverty and have limited incomes.
                    <br>
                    The privatization of the education sector has led to the rise of expensive private schools, which has made it difficult for children from marginalized groups to access quality education.
                    <br>
                    The privatization of the healthcare sector has led to the rise of expensive private hospitals, which has made it difficult for people from marginalized groups to access quality healthcare.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Indian government needs to take steps to mitigate the negative impacts of privatization on marginalized groups:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Investing in social safety nets to protect marginalized groups from job losses and income shocks.
                    Promoting inclusive economic growth that creates jobs and opportunities for marginalized groups.
                    Regulating the private sector to ensure that it pays fair wages and provides quality services.
                    Protecting the rights of marginalized groups, including their right to education, healthcare, and employment.
                    Unless the Indian government takes these steps, privatization will continue to exacerbate income inequality and marginalize marginalized groups.
